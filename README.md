# Char_Transformer_Language_Model
README
This code is an implementation of a character-level language model using a transformer architecture in PyTorch. The model is trained on a dataset of text and generates new text by predicting the next character given a sequence of previous characters. The code is implemented in such a way that it can be trained on any dataset of text.

Dependencies
PyTorch
torch
torch.nn
torch.nn.functional
Data
The code expects to find a file called input.txt in the same directory as the code. This file should contain the dataset of text that the model will be trained on. The file should contain plain text, with no formatting.

Usage
Prepare the dataset and put it in a file named input.txt in the same directory as the code.
Run the code, it will use the input.txt file as the dataset for training.
Hyperparameters
The code includes several hyperparameters that can be adjusted to control the training process and the final performance of the model:

batch_size: the number of sequences to train on at once, also known as B.
block_size: how long each context sequence is, also known as T.
max_iters: number of iterations to run the training loop.
eval_interval: how often to evaluate the model during training.
learning_rate: the learning rate for the optimizer.
eval_iters: the number of iterations to run when evaluating the model.
save_interval: how often to save the model during training.
n_embd: the embedding dimension, also known as hidden size or C.
n_head: the number of heads, also known as H.
n_layer: the number of layers, also known as L.
dropout: the dropout rate, also known as D.
Note
The model is trained on a small dataset and the performance of the model is not so good , also the model architecture is not that good and might need some improvements.
